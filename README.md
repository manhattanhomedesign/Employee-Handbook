# Employee-Handbook
For over 10 years, we didn’t have a handbook. In those 10 years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But when we grew from a company of 3 to a company of over 15, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it. It can be unnerving to join any company, but perhaps MHD in particular, given how different some of our practices are. There’s as much to unlearn as there is to learn. Prior to this handbook, navigating that path was both somewhat random and almost entirely oral. For a company that prides itself on clarity, that just wasn’t right.

So, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about MHD the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about when they call for “a zoom call”, whether it’s okay to take your vacation when you’ve only been with us for a month, what a huddle is and what Learning Fridays are and hopefully everything in-between.

This handbook also offers us an opportunity to clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Codifying those beliefs into a handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Making the company our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t articulated. So whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we're not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do.

If you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with MHD for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.
