# Who Does What?

Figuring out who to bring a particular issue or question to shouldn’t be a guessing game. Most concerns fall pretty clearly within the responsibility of a specific team at MHD, and the head of that team should be the first point of contact. At the same time, every single person who works at MHD is approachable and friendly, more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

### Executive

Daniel Levy is our CEO. He’s principally responsible for setting the overall direction of the company. That means deciding when to embark on a new version of MHD or experiment with a side project. He earned himself a Bachelors of Science degree in Oceanography from Fundacao Universidade Federal do Rio Grande and moved to the United States of America from Argentina in 2001. At this point, he considered his move as an opportunity to improve his English and imbibe some highly spoken of Western culture. 

Manhattan Home Design established its roots back in 2007, when Levy started it as a home office. With only $500 as the startup capital, Levy imported 10 tables from China and sold it on Ebay. He went on to build a company that sells modern home furnishings online and supplies furniture to government agencies. And as they say, the rest is history. 

Reminiscing the initial days of struggle, Daniel once said, “My biggest learning as an entrepreneur is that when you start your own business, you have to multitask. This gives you the liberty to differentiate between the tasks you excel at and the tasks that need to be delegated.”
